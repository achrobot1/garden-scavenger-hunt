          And so begins your scavenger hunt.
          <br />
          Please be mindful of the following rules:
        </p>
      <div style={{'textAlign': 'left'}} >
          <ul style={{'padding': '5%'}}>
          <li>All clues found in the garden can be found without perturbing the property. This means no digging or in any way altering the property</li>
          <li>All clues come in the form of a QR code that may be attached to some item</li>
          <li>Given the time constraint of the party, hints can be provided if the time spent on a clue exceeds an hour</li>
          <li>Although all clues can be solved on their own, group collaboration is permitted</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
